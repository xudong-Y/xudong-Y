### Hi there 👋 I'm Xudong.

I'm a data science professional with wonderfully diverse career to date in supply chain and fin-tech. I'm a firm believer that data science has the power to do a lot of good, that's the reason I chose to work on my most recent project with Vancouver Costal Health Research Institute: Using computer vision models to help health care professionals diagnose lipohypertrophy(a common complication among diabete patients who inject insulin) at the bed side. The deployed data product can be accessed [here](https://share.streamlit.io/xudongyang2/lipo_deploy/deployment/lipo_app.py).

Besides, I'm also a python developer with a focus on open-source data analytics packages, here's a list of packages that I authored/co-authored so far:

[sptidy](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/sptidy)

At present, my main interests are:

- 📊 Data science
- ♻️ Reproducibility & open-source
- 🌊 Climate changes
